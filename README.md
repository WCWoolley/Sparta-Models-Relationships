# Sparta-Models-Relationships
## (USE THE SAME TITLE!!!)
Your homework is to go over everything we covered today and build out another Rails project

### Your project must have:
* 3 resources (models) of your choice
* 2 of your resources must have a One-to-Many relationship with each other
* a seed file for one resource minumum (you can use Faker if you want)
* 2 of your resrouces must have validations (3 minimum each)
* Homeworks must follow the Homework Definition of Done mentioned in the Teams channel

### Some key commands:

* rake db:drop
* rake db:create
* rake db:migrate
* rake db:seed
This homework is to help you practice Active Record associations and navigating the rails console, so you will need to use the documentation
